                natashia sent 1, the second her lawywer had to talk her into it because it was so unfair. at any time she could had stop trying to lie to get the entire house and end this fairly, the length of time of this separtion falls entirelyt on natashia and her counsel. i should not have to pay natashia anything in regards about any matter pertaining to this case since shes the one lying about her false claims, shes the one dragging it out this long not me all these are her actions

          <p>
            - 29 june next report to court
          </p>
          <p>
            DONE AND SUBMITTED-- MEET WITH NOTARY THEN FILE -- file a motion on Monday to get Natashia to pay the arrears - need to inquire about car finance loan natashia still hasnt given the information maybe theres a special motion for that
          </p>
          <p>
            REFUSED -- request evidence -- All correspondence between Natashia and the finance company we refinanced our home with.
            Natashia denied counsel for me, without my knowing. There are other irregularities with the
            paperwork I have in regards to this. As I was apart of the refinance of our home just as much as
            natashia was I don’t expect any push back or refusal to comply.
          </p>
          <p>
            REFUSED -- request evidence -- Any and all correspondence in regards to refinancing our home with any financing provider that would
            have taken place in 2022 or 2023 as we started to look at refinancing in 2022. Text messages, dates and times
            of calls, emails, physical mail and so on. I should have access to this because the refinancing included us
            both, and with Natashia’s behaviour coming to light in regards to the decisions she was making for me at that
            time, that she should not have done. Natashia refused legal counsel on my behalf without my knowing, which
            was a huge mistake on her part.
          </p>
          <p>
            REFUSED -- request evidence -- All of Natashias finance documents, from when I found out about my medical condition till today's date. I
            should receive these without defiance because Natashia was in control of the finances since that event took
            place. She paid my debts, her debts, bills everything and because she is not not only affecting my credit
            negatively now, I want to make sure everything was done correctly. If denied I will bring this to court who will
            approve it. If anything is redacted, I will file a motion in regards to this request. To be clear, bank statements,
            credit card statements, everything that had to do with our finances.
          </p>
          <p>
            REFUSED -- request evidence -- When we refinanced the home last time, Natashia stated that I would be getting the remaining balance after her
            Loans, the ones she specifically told the bank with their amounts that I half paid for the moment they were put
            on the mortgage, were taken care of. I know my debts, never saw the amount that it should have after
            reviewing the documents. Natashia needs to provide all financial documents proving I was paid that amount.
            I was supposed that she set forth when she talked to the finance company. If you can’t prove it then,
            I will bring this information to the court.

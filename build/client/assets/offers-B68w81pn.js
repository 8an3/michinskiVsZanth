Multiple times, I asked natashia to lift her threats, due to this very reason, with out even a response to my pleas, it is now the winter season and I will be lucky to find employement before spring. Making it harder still, even with prior attmepts at securing employment through the regular hiring process, that avenue has been unsuccessful for me due to being head hunted for the last sales positions I have held over the last 10 years, because of how the industry operates. Every employer give the same reason when turning me down, they cant afford it and even if that can they dont want to hire someone who will leave the first chance at a higher pay structure.

Worst part about it is, for the last year i've been working 18 hours a day sometimes 24 without any sleep, go to my 9-5 come home and immediatly jump on the computer to work on a side business i started. I worked so hard, when we decided weekends were just us time, sat night after coming home we would sit to eat and have a movie lined up, without fail every single time, the moment i was done eating i would falll asleep seated straight up thats how tired i was. In comparison natashia, the odd time picked up an extra shift. Im not saying she doesnt work hard, but theres not even a comparison when you look at how much work was put into our relationmship because i wanted to take care of all our debt before wee got married, and so did she. All that hard work and the time i  sacrificed to try to get us out of that debt, she hands me a notice of no trespass as her way of showing how grateful she is. Because instead of trying that hard, i could be in bars every night, or strip clubs, or the casino or with another woman but no i was 100% devoted to her and our relationship where i valued that anhd her happiness over my own health, even to this day i still cant beleive this is happening, especially with how hard natashia is trying to get away with her claims she says i dont contribute? after the notice of no trespass, i have paid off a 3600 debt with rbc and taken care of another 52,000 with scotia bank.

I expected this behavoiur from natashia due to the separation but not from anne, this level of professionalism is just uncalled. im not a lawyer and from the looks of it i cant even talk to duty councel because i dont currently have a phone, because i have no idea how much more money this case will cost me."})})]}),e.jsxs(t,{value:"item-3",children:[e.jsx(a,{children:"window loan"}),e.jsx(o,{children:e.jsxs("p",{children:["in an attempt to make make the house appear to be more rightfully hers along with trying make me seem uncooperative, the last couple natashia has claimed that she cannot pay the loan for the home imrptovment project we did because shes not authoirized to do anything on the account, even to pay it, which isnt true confirmed by reps of the company. So they have been asking me to switch it over to natashia, at this time, i did not have a cell phone and they have really been sticking to this point for the above reasons. Every time the companyt sent me notices i forwarded it to them, and each time she asked to switch it over to her name. At this time i dont even have a means to pay it because,  i didnt have access to my bank accounts, when natashia removed me from her  cell plan, i was on her plan due to discounted rates, rbc couldnt get ahold of me and in light of that they cancelled all my credit accounts with them so i couldnt get etranfers for food or anything.  and because our money went to natashias debts and not miine, my account was already maxed in overdraft, along with natqashia emptying our  joint accunt before leaving for vacation, going into this separation i already did not have any money.

I dont understand the logic behind this point.

      Dear Mr. Zanth,

Please be aware that your "offer" is not accepted, and there are currently no agreements on the table.

Ms Michinski and I have discussed making an offer to settle, and I will be drafting one shortly. In the meantime, I would suggest that if you honestly "I just want this to end and move on with my life." you should be preparing to move out so that the house can be cleaned, prepared, and listed for sale.`},{main:"FALSE - The respondent takes no care for the home: he leaves food waste around, does not pick up and rarely takes out garbage, does not flush or clean bathroom, and does not mow the lawn or do any upkeep of the external property.

      the applicant isnt on the financing for my car, and she didnt pay for my gas... with that
logic that means every paycheck of mine was hers? because it went into a joint account
she controlled because for the last 3 years of our relationship she controlled the finances,
and before that i was in control of the finances? i will provide more bills to proof this. The
 internet is in my name, the biggest financial investment we made to the home, in my name.
if this house was only hers i would not have financed it in my name thats insane, enbridge
was in my name at the begining that she switched over to hers becasue shes been planning

To fabricate claims, she happy stealing for me and her employer, she would steal so much
From her employer she would  bring extra bags from home to stuff as much as she could
In contrast to natashia, i have provided evidence for every claim i have made thus
Far. For anything we do not have aphyical evidence for, who are you going to beleive
A known caught in the act liar and theif? Or someone who can break the law in any way
What so ever, or else he would loose out on the professional goals he set for himself? Not
Only a clean record, but you do multiple lie detector tests, contstantly which is why im so upfront
And honest, to get ready for that. For the theif part, if your unaware, she stole constantly from her employer. So much stuff that she left some
Behind when she moved out. Instead of throwing out good medial supplies, some even in its orignal
Wrapping i decided to return it to the hospital in hopes that it could be used to help patients. The only
Reason i did not do it before now, as you probaly already know, was because of how abusive she was and
I did not want to give her any more ammo against me to stasrt afights, diminish what i do or contribute,
Withheld sex as a punishment etc. To prove im not making any of this up i willk walk you through a scenario of
What she would take, when and what it was used for. I do not drink so i was doubly appalled when i found
out she was going to taking things from the hospital, syrngs and other times to be like party favours at a party
Her and her friends would put together parties and would use the medical supplies to make drinks or make
Decarations with them, for example syrngs would be used sometimes for jello shots if as witness is needed i
Can produce one. Natashia was the only one that i know of that stole from the hosptial, the ones i knew anyways
Some of them moving up in to higher positions, and wouldn’t risk lying about such a trivial event. When I found
Out natashia was doing this, i asked her why? Why couldnt you just buy this, not risk your career and a
Criminal record. I personally wanted nothing to do with it, and not wanting to risk a fight or anything like that
I just never mentioned it again. to end it looks like anne wrote this for her client, so that would mean anne lied about everything for her client.`}];return e.jsxs(i,{defaultValue:"to-do",className:"w-[95%] md:w-[800px] mx-auto my-auto",children:[e.jsxs(s,{className:"rounded-[6px] ",children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"rounded-[6px] ",value:"to-do",children:"Documents"}),e.jsx(a,{className:"rounded-[6px] ",value:"ques for duty counc",children:"Notes"})]}),e.jsx(n,{value:"to-do",children:e.jsx("iframe",{className:"mx-auto",src:"assets/Application(General)Form08-ApplicantMichinski-01-MAY-2024(2).pdf",width:"95%",height:"1000px"})}),e.jsx(n,{value:"ques for duty counc",children:e.jsxs(m,{className:"max-h-[800px] h-[800px] overflow-y-scroll",children:[e.jsx(c,{children:e.jsx(u,{children:"Responses"})}),e.jsx(p,{className:"space-y-2",children:o.map(t=>e.jsx(r,{type:"single",collapsible:!0,className:"w-full",children:e.jsxs(h,{value:t.main,children:[e.jsx(d,{children:t.main}),e.jsx(l,{children:t.title})]},t.main)}))})]})})]})}export{T as clientAction,j as clientLoader,F as default};

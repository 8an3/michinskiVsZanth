ADDING: we live out in the country, where there are more  homes with guns then without, its 45 mins past this event and my heart is still pounding from adrenaline'},{main:"order #1) Restraining order",title:`The applicant does not fear me, or fear being around me. I have never abused/harassed the applicant in any way, mental or physical. This false claim is a calculated maneuver to damage my reputation, credibility, and livelihood. To prove this false, I would like to submit a police report as evidence. At thisn time I still have not received the police report that I requested through the information of freedom act, but I’m sure it can be produced quickly at the hearing. The event took place on May 8th and I was provided the report number E240569999. I had called the authorities on the applicant because she vacated the premises more than 30 days prior, and I did not know what to do as she was there taking items from the property. I had called the authorities for guidance but because of the matter at hand they immediately dispatched officers to the scene. Once they arrived we were both questioned. During my questioning I had informed the officer what was happening and what can be done in this situation. The officer told me that since her name is on the title, they can’t remove her even if she hasn’t lived there for more than 30 days. At this time I had also asked about making a report on a stolen item that went missing, because I did not have video proof of the act, I couldn’t submit a report. I also inquired about bringing charges of mental abuse forward and to have a restraining order on Natashia, the officer responded with, “We are not equipped to deal with such matters”. The officer was supposed to have someone reach out to me about this, but never got any correspondence. After I was questioned, the officer asked if she feared for her safety with me, she responded that she did not and that she does not fear me in any way. And that she would remain on the premises to continue packing and removing things after the police officers had left. On the contrary Natashia has mentally abused me for years, seeking me out to instigate fights where she blames, shames, criticizes me and more for various reasons but the subject matter never mattered
      even if it was contradictory to the subject matter from a previous interaction. Even during our
      separation these events took place regularly. For example I was home sick with food poisoning, I was
      on the couch watching tv in the living room, where she had no belongings left to take and in a part of
      the house that was far from anything she planned to take. Obviously I was not in the condition to start
      something, but she entered the living room and instigated a fight. I have an audio recording of the
      event that I’m more than happy to share, during this audio recording I also asked for her to clarify and
      give me events that took place where I had harassed and/or abused her, she could not come up with
      such an event.
      Later in the document she claims I harassed her by email, we discussed this during that audio
      recording and she did not call it harassment. She called it scattered emails, which I will go into later.
      I was unaware of the abuse she did against me till after our relationship and discussed it with a friend
      because during our relationship Natashia asked me not to talk to anyone regarding our relationship,
      good or bad, because she wasn't. Out of respect and love I complied.
      Being a man I was never taught how to recognize these events, and just took everything on the chin.
      There were night’s where my mental state couldn’t handle these events to the point I would beg her not
      to start, or if my mental state deteriorated to the point I couldn’t take it any longer I would beg her to
      stop. Typically she wouldn’t but for example one night I begged her not to start and she just stared at
      me for several minutes not talking, turned quickly and ran around the entire house and came back to
      me telling me everything I had done wrong and threatened that it needed to be taken care of before I
      went to bed.
      If she fears for her safety so much to request this of the court, then why did she come to the residence
      after separating almost daily to pack and remove things from the property once we separated?
      She threatened to change the locks, so I asked for a leave of absence(2 weeks into our separation)
      from work to deal with the separation. So at this time I was home every day, and she still came over
      every day. Most days she was here she instigated fights and we can prove she was here by the gps
      data on her phone as she has a up to date modern Iphone that records every where you go in order to
      provide you services.
      To further prove this to be an unneeded request, the first night of our separation I called the authorities
      on Natashia because she took my dog Oliver. The authorities came, there was no evidence that I was
      abusing her and they happily left to go to their next call. The same thing happened during the call I
      talked about earlier.
      I will also submit a photo, where Natashia had driven her lawn mower from an unknown place of origin
      to the house. She had no way of escaping if I had become aggressive or abusive because she had no
      vehicle there. This is not the type of behaviour of someone in fear. This event took place Friday June
      14th of this year. It shows her on the property by the driveway where her vehicle is not seen. I also
      witnessed the applicant driving down the road on her lawn mower once she was done.
      In regards to the scattered emails, I’m mentally disabled with ADHD(registered with the federal
      government) and autism. The applicant has been aware of this since we started dating 8 or 9 years
      ago. In an effort not to forget any matter or detail in regards to this case, as soon as something
      important came up I would email her or her counsel. Natashia is used to this type of behaviour
      because we both worked on making my memory better. This claim is weaponizing my disability against
      me in order to strengthen her claims against me. Natashia works in the medical industry, and has
      received training to deal with patients, even ones with disabilities. Instead of using this training to help
      our situation, she used it to help abuse me for the last 3 years of our relationship. I say 3 years
      because I cannot remember events like this taking place before that time. I will submit all
      correspondence from the month of may to prove this, as I already included it in my answer. You will
      notice every email had a reason and I was not looking to instigate anything with Natashia. The last mail
      I sent that month to her was in regards to finding a solution for our separation. Once she learned that I
      was looking for a fair solution, she stopped responding. 9 days before that, I inquired about an account
      with a lien on the home that went into arrears. 2 days prior to that, I had another notice about the
      account in arrears and sent it to her. May 22nd I asked if she stopped making payments on the car, and
      asked which company it was with. 3 days prior to that, I emailed about a possible offer we were talking
      about in person when she came by the house. During the month of may I reached out to her 12 times,
      by email. I do not have a phone so I cannot text or call her. I do not know where she is currently
      residing so I cannot just show up at her residence. As you can see, I have not harassed or abused her
      in any way, even in the eyes of the police officers that had come by. If more evidence is needed, I can
      submit it.
      `},{main:"order #2) - Order of removal from premises",title:`The applicant claims to exclusive ownership of the home, this is false. I will explain in 3 different ways
as to how this is false.
1) At the time of signing, I was not in the right state of mind. I was still attempting to recover mentally
from my recent medical diagnosis. I was depressed, distraught, experiencing severe anxiety, and had
attempted suicide multiple times. On the day of signing, my mental state was particularly poor. During
the session, I was not fully present; I sat out most of it while the lawyer explained everything to
Natashia. I only joined the session briefly to sign the documents and requested a quick explanation. I
was told that we were putting the house in her name to satisfy the bank's requirements, and that in the
event of a separation, the house would remain jointly owned. I have now discovered this was not the
case. Natashia was aware of my mental state at the time, as she had previously advised me to take
time off work to address my issues. Despite my concerns about our financial situation, she convinced
me that we could afford it. To avoid straining our relationship, I compartmentalized my struggles. If
Natashia disputes my mental health condition at that time, I can obtain a written statement from my
doctor. From my years in sales, I know that a contract is not valid if the signer is not in the right state
of mind, such as being intoxicated or under duress. This scenario meets those requirements, making
the contract invalid if it states anything other than a 50/50 financial split of our family home, as it was
before the contract
2): In the event the court does not accept my mental state at the time of signing, I must clarify my
intentions. When we refinanced the home, it was to pay off debt and improve our lives. It was not
clearly explained to me, and I never intended to completely sign over my financial share of the home to
Natashia. Given the frequency of failed relationships, doing so would be financially irresponsible. We
had previously refinanced the home without issues (see First Refinancing Contract from answer), and
there were no problems when we initially bought the house (see Original Purchase Agreement For
Ashburn Rd from answer). At that time, I completely trusted Natashia. I don't know if she had been
planning this all along or is now taking advantage of the situation. I do know she was planning the
separation for some time based on her actions leading up to it. She began removing items from the
property before her vacation, cleaned out our joint checking account, and served me a notice of no
trespass immediately upon her return. It took me two and a half weeks to contact legal aid, only to find
out I didn’t qualify. Drafting the notice must have taken her lawyer some time. Given the
circumstances, legally a resulting trust would be in effect. The contract was explained to me as being
required by the bank, and no money was transferred to me. Further proof of this can be shown through
the fact that we tried to refinance prior without success multiple times and each time tried to include
me on the title, I will submit proof of one of the times as evidence. Natashia is attempting to take
advantage of a situation of unjust enrichment (see Second Refinancing Contract to prove no money
was transferred). With accordance to the law, the only fair settlement is for Natashia to return 50% of
the financial value of the home to me once it is sold. As she was only to hold it for me to appease the
bank's requirements. If needed I do have a large pdf with various supporting documents.
3) When my wages started to get garnished, due to the refinancing, we had to prove that I did not
receive any funds from the refinancing. Natashia forwarded me a ledger to support this. In that email
exchange Natashia explains to the refinance company why we are refinancing. That we were only
refinancing to better our financial situation and that's it. She also refused, without my knowing, legal
counsel for me as we were not separating. This was to only appease the requirements set forth from
the bank because it was the bank's idea to have me off of the title, not Natashias. From these events it
proves our intentions at the time, that the house was still both ours and not just hers and we would
still both live there since we were still planning to get married, once our financial situation improved,
and in the event of a separation, we would both get 50% of the sale of the house proceeds. Again a
resulting trust is in place. Not only that but in the refinance contract Natashia signed off on, it states
that I’m her spouse. Along with that there are a number of other questionable irregularities with the
contract.

      has come to my attention that I do not have anywhere to go and would be living on the street if
      removed before the sale of our family home. Natashia emptied our joint account, which my pay
      deposited into, right before she left on an unannounced vacation. Also how can i add rule 18 of the family law rules, i offered a reasonable offer to settle while natashia hasnt and also refused my offer.

She threatens to charge me rent, but yet does not follow any rule/guideline/law set forth by the landlord and tenant act. When she first threatened me with this, the day after our separation.
      Among other laws, not once did she give me notice that she was coming over to enter the residence to take things. A landlord needs to provide 24-48 notice to enter the domicile.(GPS data will be used as evidence as she was here, and she cannot provide a notice to enter because I never received one) natashia has a history of diminishing everything i do, whether its money, cleaning up around the house, it doesnt matter what it is, she always finds a way to diminish my contribution to it. If I clean a bathroom for 10 mins or an hour and a half she puts me down, gives me shit and more. I mentioned it in the answer but ill go over it again here. I needed an oil change in fear of getting yelled and bitched at, i held off as long as i could to get it done. I brought it up when i couldnt wait any longer and she lost it on me, saying why didnt u take the money out last week. 6 months later, another oil change is needed, i take the money out just like she instructed... same thing happens, she states you stole money from me(even though it was out of our joint account), how dare you, you better prove it with receipts, you need to pay it back(even though she already gets my entire check), anyways you see where this is going. this was a recurring theme. For the last 3 years i beleived her, because of my mental disabilty. I thought i was going crazy, how can do so much wrong all of a sudden, i was doing so well... but it was because of her, it took us to break up for me to see that, well a friend told me but i never would have told her. she terrorized me for years, i had massive mental break downs because of it. i jsut wanted to be better for her, but no matter how hard i tried or did to become better i was never good enough and now shes trying to steal from me and ruin me. after the first hearing i threw up, when i read the reply the first half way through i threw up.

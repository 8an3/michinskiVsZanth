I have already provided ample evidence to demonstrate that many of their claims are false. Despite my requests, they fail to provide proof, either verbally or in writing.

      For instance, regarding the abuse allegations made by Natashia, I asked her on audio to provide an example, and she could not identify a single event. Court proceedings are supposed to be conducted fairly and in good faith. Their entire case is built on a lie, and they are fabricating additional lies to support the initial falsehood.

      It's not just Natashia who is lying; her counsel is also engaging in these deceptive practices. This undermines the very concept of justice. The scales of justice are being unfairly tilted in their favor through dishonest tactics, such as submitting crucial paperwork just an hour and a half before the deadline, giving me no time to prepare never mind study the necessary topics in law.

      how is it i have to swear to a notary that everything ive written on my court filings are true, everyhing ive lined out in the documents are in fact true and get it signed off on, while at the same time natashia can just out right lie on her court filings with no repercussions? seems odd to me, or is it because I dont have a lawyer i can use as a shield, for example oh there was a miscommunication between my lawyer and i. her lawyer is representing her, not shielding her completely for making false claims on documents she was sworn to tell the truth? the applicants certifacate clearly states that by signing it everything stated is true, and it isnt.

      I am currently without representation, not by choice, adding to that Im also mentally disabled, and can barely come up with money to help me due to natashias actions, which further puts me at a disadvantage. The dishonest tactics employed by Natashia and her counsel should not be allowed to influence the outcome of this case. I would like the court to put forth some action or order against natashia, i dont know what because im representing myself, but something needs to be done.`},{main:"SPOUSE/COMMON LAW CAN THESE PEOPLE MAKE UP THEIR MINDS?",title:"labeled as spouse on page 4 of second refinancing docs and other places on thiks contract"},{main:"in second offer, they want me to sign",title:"off on that I did not want legal advice. which is not true like get the fuck out of here, the only reason i cannot afford legal advice is because of natashia i will never sign that because i have been trying to get legal advice every step of this process"},{main:"LAWYERS CERTIFICATE",title:"why isnt annes signature on the lawyer cert on natashia paperwork? what is the significance of the lawyer cert?"},{main:"COUNSEL COMMITS PERJURY",title:"what happens when councel commits perjury?"},{main:"FILE TO MOTION",title:"wwhat is the procedure to file a motion?"},{main:"CUNT PRESENT DURING SERVING",title:"paperwork for court filing dated for may 1st, was contacted by vespry 15 and natashia countless 10 + times, not once was this court filing mentioned till may 30th by email, she claimed someone was sent to my house numerous times, but I never saw them, prior to this point vespry contacted me 8 times by email and knew this was a reliable way to contact me along with natashia stopping by the house 3-4 times a week since then, she never mentioned it once to me. Yes i know she cant deliver the documents herself to me. But she didnt even let me know what was going on till after the 30 days was reached. This would suggest both natashia and her lawyer are trying to continue these negotiations while sabatoging my part in this matter especially without counsel. why was natashia present when I was served? I was told by her counsel she could not be invloved in this process, through my research I cant find an answer to this and her counsel failed twice in answering this. The first attempt in questioning about this she completely ignored me, the second attempt she brushed over this part of the question. So just clarification because I want to learn this the right way. So why was natashia present when I was served when her cousel advised she couldnt be? she claims natashia couldnt deliver the whole month of may, but then delivers a week after i was served? this gave me no time to prepare, for a case they shouldnt even have to employ these tactics, they have forced me into more and more of a disadvatange. meanwhile i had 15*** points of contact with anne that month after she filed, when you send someone something over an hour out of town, what do you usually do? you notify them right? and make sure that they are there to receive what ever you are sending them? ya this proves thier intentions. if shes allowed to do it then her counsel lied in writing, if not than how can that service be valid?"},{main:"PRIVATE PROSECUTION",title:"how do i go about privetly prosecuting natashia, in regards to fraud, theft and spousal abuse?"},{main:"UNFINISHED PAPERWORK",title:"Natashia forgot to do the financial paperwork because shes make a exclusive claim on the property, multiple times on the paperwork it says this is needed"},{main:"OLIVER",title:"can I file to get my dog back early"},{main:"PAPERWORK MISTAKES IN CONTRACTS",title:"massive mistake on the page where Natashia solemnly declares on the contract that made me give her my half"},{main:"SPOUSE IN CONTRACTS",title:"on same contract under conditions of approval it calls me a spouse, so which the fuck is it? mortgage commitment page 1 refinance contract page 4"},{main:"RULE 18 OF FAMILY LAW RULES",title:"how can i add rule 18 of the family law rules, i offered a reasonable offer to settle while natashia hasnt and also refused my offer."},{main:"CONTROLLED FINANCES FOR FIRST HALF",title:"i controlled the finances for the first half of our time in this house, have proof. it was obviously not hers, shes either trying to steal it with years of planning or trying to take advantage of the situation"},{main:"TRUST HER AFTER STEALING?",title:"Natashia asking to trust her with the value from the home, and leave early, after she stole my % from me....ya ok"},{main:"NATASHIA WAS GIVEN LOGIN DETAILS BY TEXT MESSAGE FIND THESE",title:"in a text message you give her login details for one of our services I think it Disney in order for her to make changes on the account proving her lying again"},{main:"AFFIDAVIT EACH TIME?",title:"is there a way to not have to get a affidavit each time? especially since natashia has yet to tell the truth on more than one item.
